        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to obtain
        an estimation of user agent CPU utilization they cause, and also
        browser-specific hints whether their CPU utilization is higher than
        desired.

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should <a href=
        "https://github.com/andrey-logvinov/cpu-usage-api/issues">subscribe to
        the repository on GitHub</a> and take part in the discussions.
      </p>

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        As web applications can consume significant amounts of computation
        resources e.g. by executing Javascript code (possibly in multiple
        threads using Web Workers), it becomes relevant whether they create
        an undiserably high strain on the system running the browser. It can be
        especially critical for mobile devices running on batteries as high
        CPU utilization dramatically decreases autonomous runtime barring the
        user not only from using the application but also from using the device
        at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        A proactive web application can take into account its CPU utilization
        level and throttle it cooperatively in case it becomes too high. In
        addition to quantitative information about CPU utilization, a browser
        can also provide qualitative hints to the application about whether the
        current CPU utilization level is too high so that the application
        doesn't have to analyze CPU utilization numerical values. Also, when
        producing such hints, a browser can take into account system state
        parameters such as whether the charger is connected.

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <pre class="example highlight">
navigator.getApplicationCPU().then(function(cpu) {

  console.log("CPU utilization: " + cpu.level * 100 + "%");
  console.log("CPU utilization is " + (cpu.high ? "high" : "normal"));

  cpu.addEventListener("levelchange", function() {
    console.log("CPU utilization changed: " + cpu.level * 100 + "%");
  });

  cpu.AddEventListener("highchange", function() {
    console.log("CPU utilization changed, is now " +
        (cpu.high ? "high" : "normal"));
  });

}, function() {
  console.log("CPU utilization information is not available");
});
</pre>

    <section>
      <h2>CPU utilization information</h2>
      <p>
        Information about CPU utilization of a web application can be expressed
        either quantitatively (amount of CPU consumed) or qualitatively (within
        or beyond <a>user agent</a>-dependent limits). Quantitative information
        can allow a web application to evaluate an impact of its activities on
        CPU and battery utilization, while qualitative information can allow web
        applications to react to situations when <a>user agent</a> deems web
        application's CPU utilization inacceptably high.
      </p>
      <p>
        As web applications sharing the same <a>user agent</a> are not
        necessarily as distinctly separated in terms of resource consumption as
        native operating system applications, as e.g. in case when multiple web
        applications are sharing <a>user agent</a>'s operating system processes
        and/or threads, it should be expected that CPU utilization measure is
        only an estimation of the actual value whose accuracy is <a>user agent
        </a>-dependent.
      </p>
      <p>
        When deciding to inform a web application about high CPU utilization
        level, <a>user agent</a> may take into account possible transient nature
        of elevated CPU consumption and avoid excessive amounts of notification
        messages, e.g. by only issuing a notification when the CPU utilization
        is consistently high during a set time interval.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          This specification deals specifically with attribution of CPU
          utilization to individual web applications rather than providing
          access to the the overall level of CPU utilization of the user agent
          or the underlying operating system.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>CPU utilization attribution granularity</h2>
      <p>
        CPU utilization is attributed to the web application as a whole, i.e.
        it is calculated as an estimation of total utilization level of the
        application's <a>top-level browsing context</a> and all its directly and
        indirectly <a>nested browsing context</a>s.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          The reason behind this decision is that CPU utilization level
          information can also be used by the <a>user agent</a> to notify the
          user about a problematic application and/or preemptively terminate the
          application on behalf of the user to avoid excessive CPU consumption
          when the device is running on battery. It makes no sense either to
          notify the user about particular <a>browsing context</a> within the
          application or to terminate the web application partially. Also, it
          may be significantly more challenging to implement a document-level
          CPU utilization measurement in the user agent than a window/tab-level
          measurement.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        To avoid confusion with CPU utilization attribution, <a>user agent</a>
        must only expose CPU utilization information to the <a>top-level
        browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>.
